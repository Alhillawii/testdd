        there is debate over whether mathematical ogjects such as numbers and point exist natueally or are human creative.the mathematicion benjamin price called "the scince that draws necssary cincluions,"

       , on the order hand, staed that"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality,they are not certain, and as far as they are certian, they do not refer to realy."
